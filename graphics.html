            <h1>GRAPHICS</h1>
            <p>At UVA, I created graphics for multiple organizations including 
                the University Programs Council, HackCville, and VSA@UVA. I always make sure each graphic has a story to tell. 
                I highlighted some of my favorite projects below but contact me for my full portfolio :)</p>

                    <h2>VSA STICKERS</h2>
                    <p>Giving back always warms me up. As a board member for VSA, I wanted to come up with a creative way to raise money for Messengers of Love. 
                        Thus, I designed these stickers and sold them as a way to raise extra money for Messengers of Love while promoting VSA’s semiannual “Phofest.” 
                        My campaign proved to be successful as over 100 units were sold in under a week. It was rewarding seeing my designs make an impact on our community.

                    <h2>UPC EVENT QR CODE</h2>
                    <p>As a marketing analyst for UPC, my director came to me with the issue of how the previous year’s “Artisan Cheeses & Masterpieces” was met with chaos as there was not an effective way to keep track of student’s pottery for pick-up. 
                        I took the initiative to make a graphic with a QR code that links to a Google form that made pick-up streamlined.

                    <h2>HACKCVILLE GRAPHIC</h2>
                    <p>AAs a HackCville marketing coordinator, I was tasked with creative ways to advertise for the annual NYC Start-Up Trip. After research on how to use Adobe Illustrator, I crafted a flyer that was used in internal campaigns (Slack, email, etc). 
                        The use of a QR code increased traction to the website and conversions for the event.

                    <h2>STARBUCKS DALGONA</h2>
                    <p>Dalgona whipped coffee was all the rage during the beginning of stay-at-home orders. 
                        This inspired me to make a mock-up Instagram advertisement for Starbucks with the drink. 
                        Deviating a bit from the brand image, I made this graphic more catered towards younger audiences.

                    <h2>F21 SPLASH PAGE</h2>
                    <p>While doing research on website development, I learned that splash pages are an effective way to increase conversions on a website. 
                        This inspired me to mock up a splash page for Forever 21 with a 21% sale. 
                        I stayed true to the company’s aesthetic and brand image by incorporating bold colors and a mixture of fonts.
