                <h1>你好！I'M VICTOR</h1>
                <p>Hey y'all! I am a creative who loves to explore various digital mediums like photography, graphic design, 
                    and wireframing. In my free time, you can catch me brushing up on these skills.</p>
                <p>
                    A cool fun fact about me is that my parents own a bakery in the Eden Center, 
                    the largest Vietnamese shopping center on the East Coast! Also, I grew up in a Vietnamese-Chinese household. 
                    My story confuses a lot of people but long story short: 
                    my family is ethnically Chinese but they just were born and raised in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I enjoy trying out new foods, testing the latest skincare craze, and scrolling through Twitter memes! 
                    My perfect day would consist of a morning workout, doing some work in a cute cafe, cheffing up a new recipe for dinner, 
                    and doing my elaborate skincare before bed.</p>

                                I love trying out different skincare products to see what works best for me! As someone with combo skin, 
                                the journey does get tricky! Current favorite skincare lines include The Ordinary, Purito, and First-Aid Beauty.</p>
